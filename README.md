I'm a longtime lover of strategy, problem solving and logical thinking; moving from being just an economics graduate who spends too much time on his computer to one who still does, but now uses it to make things and solve problems. I'm also into finance, regularly keep up to date with various publications such as The Economist and FT, make electronic music, take pictures, have written a screenplay and various short stories and am an avid lover of video games.

## Skills

#### Learning to code in 12 weeks

From a start of absolutely zero knowledge on the matter, thanks to an innate drive and ability to learn quickly and effectively I was able to create several projects using various languages and frameworks during my time at Makers, while adhering strictly to OO best practices such as SOLID and DRY. Always trying to channel Sandi Metz. Good knowledge of Ruby and Javascript, currently teaching myself C#.

#### Human Interaction

From being social, to working in a team, to public speaking, I am most in my element when I am surrounded by people. My relaxed, positive, can-do attitude has allowed me to be a positive asset for my teams in several situations, both when it comes to getting work done and not succumbing to stress.
